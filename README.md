Cross 3 - Scene manager and pause menu

For this update of the game, I created a start menu for the game that allows the player to select between, starting the game, exiting the game and the controls for the game. A game over screen, a death screen and a level win screen now exist. The pause menu was created for the game. With a life count on the screen that the player can use to tell how many lives the player currently has.

The start screen has three buttons that: start the game, show the game controls and exit the game. When the player's health counter reaches 0, it loads the death scene and reduces the player's life counter by 1. After 3 deaths the game loads the Game Over scene and the game will have to be restarted. In the pause menu the lives the player has left can be found and a button that exits the game as well. 

In the next update the player will have a life bar to see on the screen along with the lives being accurate to the player's life count.
